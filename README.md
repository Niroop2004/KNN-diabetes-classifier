# KNN-diabetes-classifier
This project implements a machine learning pipeline using the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm to classify whether a patient is diabetic or not, based on medical attributes. It includes data pre-processing, feature normalization, model training, evaluation for different values of k, and a user input interface for real-time prediction.
